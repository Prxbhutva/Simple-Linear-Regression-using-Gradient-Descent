Simple Linear Regression from Scratch using Gradient Descent
🚀 Implemented Simple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent to deeply understand the underlying math and workflow of fitting a line to data.

📊 Dataset
Generated a synthetic regression dataset using sklearn.datasets.make_regression.

⚙️ Implementation
Computed Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function.

Used Gradient Descent to update parameters and minimize MSE.

Compared R² score with sklearn's LinearRegression to validate correctness (scores matched!).

📈 Visualization
Plotted data points.

Plotted the regression line learned by:

sklearn's LinearRegression

My custom Gradient Descent implementation.

🧠 Key Learnings
How parameter updates happen during Gradient Descent.

Impact of learning rate on convergence and stability.

Connection between MSE minimization and R² score improvement.

🚀 Tech Stack
Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn (for data generation and validation)
